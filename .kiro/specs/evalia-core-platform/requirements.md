# Requirements Document - Evalia Core Platform

## Introduction

Evalia is an intelligent platform for evaluating, benchmarking, securing, and improving large language model (LLM) applications. The platform enables AI engineers, security teams, compliance officers, and researchers to understand how their prompts perform across tasks, domains, and models â€” while ensuring applications meet security standards and compliance requirements.

The platform provides comprehensive capabilities including prompt evaluation, AI-powered optimization, git-like version control, security penetration testing, and SOC2 compliance validation. It maintains a terminal-style aesthetic with a dark theme, providing a developer-focused experience while offering enterprise-grade security and compliance features.
